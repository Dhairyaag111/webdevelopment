DOM stands for document object model 
It is a programming interface that allows js to interact with css and html - so that scripts can read , modify and contro the structure style and content of webpage
Think of i tlike this: HTML builds the house, CSS decorates the house and JS controlls the lights, doors and everything inside
So, When a webpage is loaded and the browser converts html into tree like structure and thats the DOM tree 

How browser creates DOM?
i.   The browser download your html file 
ii.  It parses the html from top to bottom 
iii. Every tag becomes an object(node) in memory
iv.  These node are linked together to forming a DOM tree
v.   JS can then use the document object to access and modify these nodes
  

DOM tree visualization- Each HTML element becomes a node in a tree:
ROOT NODE:   <html> </html>
BRANCH NODE: <head> </head>  
             <body> </body>  
             <div> </div>  etc.           
LEAF NODE: text content inside tags
 

Window, Document.navigator
When a webpage loads, the browser creates several global object 
i.   Window : It represents the browser window itself. 
     It is the top most object in the hierarchy. 
     It content everything including the document.

ii.  Document : It represent the webpage(html document) currently loaded in the window

iii. Navigator : Represents the browser being used.
