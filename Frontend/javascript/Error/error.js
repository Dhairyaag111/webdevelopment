//  handling real world errors in java script or any other programming languages is known as error handling.

// In java script we use try, catch, finally, throw to handle all types of error

// Example:- We are building a payment system , user enters a card number. If the number is invalid our app might crash so, at that time we will catch errors, show a message, and continue running the app.

// So, this is what error handling is made for.

// Try - This is the bloch where we try to run some code

// Catch - This is the block where errors are cut

// Finally - This is the optinal block that runs whatever happens

// Throw - This is the block where we create our manual errors and throw it
