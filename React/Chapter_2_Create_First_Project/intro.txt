Project Structure

ii. public - This folder contains all the static files of our project 

iii. src - This is the major folder where we write our react code. It usuall contains main.jsx(Entry point), App.jsx(root component), pages, hooks, styles etc.

    a. App.jsx - It is the main react component which is called by main.jsx
    b. App.css - This is the css file for App.jsx
    c. index.css - It is the global css used for body styles, reset css etc
    d. main.jsx - This is the entry point and this is where react starts

iv. .gitignore - This files tells git what not to track

v. eslint.config.js - It defines linting rules, helps catch bugs and bad practices

vi. index.html - This is the single HTML files, react mounts into this

vii. package-lock.json - This flie locks exact dependency version

viii. package.json - This file stores project names, dependency, scripts etc. When we run npm run dev, everything comes from here. This is the meta data of our project
